# Project List

- Name: ![Assembly/C Programs](https://github.com/aprak5/AssemblyCPrograms). Description: The purpose of these programs was to familiarize myself with different aspects of Assembly, C, and lower-level programming.
  
- Name: ![Basic Artificial Intelligence Projects](https://github.com/aprak5/BasicAIProjects). Description: All projects above were developed to explore various artificial intelligence concepts, such as DFS, A* Search, Simulated Annealing, Linear Programming, Minimax, D-Separation, and Predicate Logic. 

- Name: ![C# Applications](https://github.com/aprak5/CSharpApps). Description: All projects help practice requirements analysis, UI/UX design, software design, and MVC design skills while addressing practical small-scale business scenarios.

- Name: ![Covid-19 Knapsack Problem Project](https://github.com/aprak5/CovidKnapsackProject). Description: This project focuses on the knapsack problem for Covid-19 cases between 10 counties where 3 hospitals will be opened. The knapsack problem in this case is to open the three hospitals to maximize the Covid-19 cases covered out of all other combinations of counties.

- Name: ![Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/aprak5/MLApps). Description: All the projects here are focused on different machine learning concepts, such as data cleaning, artificial neural networks, decision trees, clustering algorithms, the principal component algorithm, and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm.

- Name: ![Privacy Projects](https://github.com/aprak5/PrivacyProjects). Description: All the projects here are focused on different privacy concepts, such as deanonymization attacks, differential privacy, domain request rules, federated learning, and model inversion attacks.

- Name: ![R Project](https://github.com/aprak5/RProject). Description: This project explores basic exploratory data analysis (EDA - numeric summaries and graphs), data transformations, and then some linear regression models.

- Name: ![Theoretical Java Projects](https://github.com/aprak5/TheoreticalJavaProjects). Description: These Java projects focus on some theoretical problems such as different data structures, the bumper cars problem, the dining threads problem, and the game of life.
